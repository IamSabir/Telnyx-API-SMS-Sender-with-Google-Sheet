# Telnyx-API-SMS-Sender-with-Google-Sheet
Here, I am going to share the way how you can embed the Telnyx in a google sheet to send SMS from the Google Sheet itself where you can include different senders, different receivers, with different messages. 

Make a copy of the following spreadsheet

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ugozKNfNTuQVsnT12cjj-eyMJlWrfcoUzlZTq7Mj978/edit?usp=sharing

Once done, oen the app script of the new spreadsheet you created and then change the API creds.

Now, you are ready to send SMS from Google Spreadsheet using the Telnyx SMS API
